Today I was trying to verify which lines of output from https://jbang.dev[jbang] were standard out and which is standard error to write a better https://karatelabs.github.io/karate/[karate] based test.

Reminded me I needed it before and found I had https://sourceforge.net/projects/hilite/[`hilite`] installed.

A tool that does nothing than highlight standard error in red.

So now instead of:

image::/images/nolite-output.png[width=100%]

I get:

image::/images/hilite-output.png[width=100%]

Clearly verifing that indeed the error is on standard error. Letting 
me add the last test to relase https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/releases/tag/v0.89.1[JBang 0.89.1].

On OSX I got `hilite` by using `brew install hilite`.

Have fun!
