== Introduction

Hello, Java enthusiasts! Today, I'm excited to share a tool that I believe will make your database interactions much simpler. If you've worked with Java databases, you know that setting up JDBC connections can sometimes be a bit cumbersome. That's where my JBang script, conveniently named `jdbc`, comes into play. It's designed to streamline the process, making your life as a developer a bit easier.

== What is JBang?

For the uninitiated, JBang is a tool that allows Java applications to be run in a script-like manner. It eliminates the need for boilerplate code, simplifying the execution and even installation of Java applications.

== Features of the 'jdbc' Script

The `jdbc` script is a nifty tool with some compelling features:

* *Ease of Use:* Run https://github.com/julianhyde/sqlline[`sqlline`] just by specifying the JDBC URL.
* *Driver Management:* Automatically downloads the required driver for your database.
* *JBang all the way down:* Use JBang, to make it all just work.

== How to Use the 'jdbc' Script

Using the script is as straightforward as it gets:

. Run Directly: Execute `jbang jdbc@maxandersen` in your terminal.
. Install with JBang: Use `jbang app install jdbc@maxandersen` to install, and then simply run `jdbc`.

== Example in Action

Let's say you want to connect to an Oracle database. Normally, you'd have to manually handle drivers and set up the connection. With `jdbc`, it's just a matter of executing:

[source,shell]
----
jbang jdbc jdbc:oracle:thin:@myoracle.db.server:1521:my_sid
----

The script takes care of everything else, launching sqlline with the correct driver.

If you want to pass additional arguments to `sqlline` you can pass them after a double-dash (`--`), like this:

[source,shell]
----
jdbc jdbc:sqlite:sample.db -- -e "select * from mytable"
----

== Behind the Scenes

Developing this script was very simple. Find a blog listing a https://vladmihalcea.com/jdbc-driver-maven-dependency/[bunch of Maven artifact locations] for common databases, and a https://www.baeldung.com/java-jdbc-url-format[blog with jdbc url examples] and I was off to the races. 

With some help from chatgpt I just outlined the idea with links to the above pots and most was done.

The script currently supports the following databases:

    - Derby
    - Firebird
    - H2
    - Hsqldb
    - Informix
    - Mariadb
    - Mysql
    - Oracle
    - PostgreSQL
    - SAP
    - SQL Server
    - SQLLite
    
== Looking Ahead

I could see a few future improvements in making it even easier to make jdbc urls and connect but wanted to get this out as its already quite useful. 

== Join the Journey

I encourage you to try out the script and see how it can streamline your workflow. Your feedback is invaluable, so please share your experiences, suggest improvements, or https://github.com/maxandersen/jbang-catalog/blob/master/jdbc.java[even contribute] to its development.

== Conclusion

The `jdbc` script is a testament to how a tool like JBang can make Java development more efficient and enjoyable. I hope you find it as useful as I do in your daily coding adventures!

Have fun!
